# TelegramChannelCondenser
NUS HackNRoll 2022 Submission

&nbsp;

## Inspiration
Often when browsing for jobs or paid studies, people keep reposting or multiple channels post the same thing
## What it does
Filters out the "Extra" messages
## How we built it
Python via Replit using telegram bots
## Challenges we ran into
Mainly time and manpower constraint and that bots have no access to channels
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Able to sort of function as a personal bot instead of a scalable one
## What we learned
Web scraping & more
## What's next for Telegram Channel Condenser
Multiple users with machine learning elements and less lag
